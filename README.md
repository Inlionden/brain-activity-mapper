# üß† Brain Activity Mapper

A Gradio application that visualizes potential brain activity based on a user's description of a task. It uses Google's Gemini API for advanced keyword extraction and GloVe word embeddings for semantic mapping to brain regions.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Natural Language Input**: Describe any activity, from "reading a book" to "playing the piano from sheet music."
- **AI-Powered Keyword Extraction**: Leverages the Gemini API to intelligently identify the most relevant keywords (actions, objects, concepts, senses).
- **Semantic Brain Mapping**: Uses GloVe word embeddings to calculate the semantic similarity between extracted keywords and the known functions of various brain regions.
- **Interactive SVG Visualization**: Displays a color-coded brain map where the top 3 most activated regions are highlighted. Hovering over a region shows its name.
- **Detailed Analysis**: Provides a ranked list of activated regions, their corresponding lobes, and the calculated similarity score.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The application follows a two-stage process:

1.  **Keyword Extraction**: The user's sentence is sent to the Gemini API with a specific prompt asking it to pull out essential keywords.
2.  **Vector Similarity Mapping**:
    *   The `BrainRegionMapper` class pre-loads a GloVe word embedding model (`glove-wiki-gigaword-100`).
    *   It creates an "average" vector for each brain region based on a predefined list of associated keywords (e.g., the "Visual Area" is represented by the average of the vectors for "see," "light," "color," etc.).
    *   When new keywords arrive from Gemini, their vectors are averaged to create an "input vector."
    *   **Cosine similarity** is calculated between this input vector and each of the pre-calculated brain region vectors.
    *   The regions with the highest similarity scores are considered the most "activated" and are highlighted on the map.
